## FAQ

**Do I need a computer?**

Yes.

**What are the prerequisites for this workshop?**

Basic React, JS, ES6, HTML Knowledge.

**Do I need to set up a local environment?**

No. Everything we code will be on [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) so all you need is a computer with internet access.
I will probably even run the workshops in a ChromeBook.
